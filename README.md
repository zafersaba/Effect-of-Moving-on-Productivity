# Investigating The Change in Inventor Productivity After Moving: Evidence from US Patent Data

This paper focuses on the causal effect of moving on the productivity of inventors, using US patent data with approximately 1.3 million different patents produced by 587,276 different inventors between 2004 and 2020. Using German data, Hoisl (2007) shows that moving to a different firm has a positive effect on the productivity of inventors on average but does not consider moves to a new location. This paper investigates moves to a different state together with moves to a different firm to understand the separate effect of moving to a new location, and the interaction between these. I confirm Hoisl (2007) also holds with US Patent data, i.e., changing firms leads to an increase in productivity. I find no evidence that moving to a new location leads to an increase in productivity after controlling for firm change. I also find that the estimated coefficient for the interaction between firm change and location change is negative.
